## Critical Blocker

**Registration at lu.ma/mistralhack-online requires human action.**

- URL: https://lu.ma/mistralhack-online
- Action: Click "Request to Join" (requires Luma account login)
- Approval: Rolling review by Mistral team; confirmations ~1 week before event (≈Feb 21)
- **If not submitted by Feb 17:** Approval buffer shrinks dangerously

## Contingency Rule

> If no registration proof by **Feb 21 UTC** → trigger **NO-GO**, redirect all bandwidth to other lanes.
